# Number Theory
## Subsets of Numbers 
**Intergers**
$...., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ....$
> using for counting indivisible objects  such as people, cars, etc...

**whole Numbers**
$0, 1, 2, 3, ....$

**Counting Numbers (Natural Numbers)**
$1, 2, 3, ....$

## Even, ODD, Prefect Squares
**Even**
- even numbers formula is $2k$ where k is natural number

**Odd**
- odd numbers formula is $2k + 1$ where k is natural number

>so if we apply even formula on ***zero*** we find $2 * 0 = 0$ so Zero is actually even

**Perfect Powers**
- is an integer that is equal to some integer to a power that is at least 2
>Example 
>$3^2 = 9$ so $9$ is `perfect square`
>$2^3 = 8$ so $8$ is `perfect cub`


## Multiples & Divisors
**Multiple**
- multiple of an integer is the product of that integer with any integer 
>Example
>$12$ is ***mulitple*** of $3$ because $12$ is divisible by 3

- An integer m is ***divisible*** by another intger $n$ when the quotient $\frac{m}{n}$ is also an integer


**Divisor**
- an integer $d$ is a ***divisor*** of an integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is ***divisible*** by $d$.
- ***Divisors*** is also called ***factors***
- A ***Proper divisor*** of an integer $n$ is a positive divisor of $n$ that is not $n$.


>ðŸ’¡ for any integer $m$ and $n$, their product $mn$ is both ***amultiple*** of $m$ and a ***multiple*** of $n$


>ðŸ’¡ when $d\neq0$, the following statements all mean the same thing:
>- $n$ is a multiple fo $d$
>- $n$ is divisible by $d$
>- $d$ is a divisor of $n$
>- $d$ divides $n$

>ðŸ’¡
>- if $a$ is a divisor of $b$ and $b$ is a divisor of $c$, then $a$ is adivisor of $c$
>- if $b$ is divisible by $a$ and $c$ is divisible by $b$, then $c$ is divisible by $a$
>- if $b$ is multiple of $a$ and $c$ is a multiple of $b$, then $c$ is a multiple fo $a$
>- if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$

>ðŸ’¡
>- addition & subtraction and also power is fast **counting**
>- multiplication is a fast ***addation***
